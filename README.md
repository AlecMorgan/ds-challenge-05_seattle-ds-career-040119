## Plotting Attendance

### 0. Getting Started

Start by forking this repo and cloning your fork to your computer.

### 1. Business Understanding

You want to understand when your cohort typically arrives on campus.

### 2. Data Understanding

Each of you has access to an attendance spreadsheet that now contains five days of arrival times for you and your colleagues.

### 3. Data Preparation

#### 3(a) Load the data

* Create a Jupyter Notebook.

* Using whatever technique seems most appropriate to you, collect the arrival time data and load it into a Pandas dataframe. _Do not include student names_. Hint: Try simply copying and pasting the relevant columns into a text file!


#### 3(b) Visualize the data

* Create some visualizations of the attendance data. Note that it can be grouped by date or aggregated together.

* At least one of your visualizations _must_ be a histogram.
